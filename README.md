### [refer](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/refer) : refers to all public vars of ns, subject to filters. 
    - Use :refer sparingly. Itâ€™s good for symbols that have no alphabetic characters, such as >! <! >!! <!! in core.async, or heavily-used macros such those in clojure.test.
    - You can combine :refer and :as in the same :require clause.
